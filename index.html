  <p>It's amazing that github allows you to add files and make commits directly from your web browser.</p>
  <em>It is also amazing, but less so, that you can tab in their WYSIWYG editor and it doesn't change context on you.</em>
  <b>nothing is amazing</b>
  <p>Hell, it's about time we updated this</p>
  <h3>And heeeeere comes the update!</h3>
  <p><em>Updating this to be more in line with common best practices....</em></p>
  <p>Please attend the retro at 4pm next funday so that we can share our strengths, weaknesses, points of high team synergy, and points of low team siloing...</p>
